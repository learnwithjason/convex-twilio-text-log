# Text-To-Post App Using Convex HTTP Actions, Twilio, and Clerk

Convex HTTP actions allow you to create URL endpoints that directly interact with your Convex database. In this app, you'll learn how to build a React + TypeScript app that allows a user to register for an account with their phone number using Clerk, then send text and images via SMS to a Twilio number that sends incoming messages to a Convex-powered webhook to validate and store the data.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- How to set up a Convex database and schema with end-to-end type safety
- How to integrate Convex with Clerk for user authenticated database interaction
- How to create HTTP actions that can be used as webhooks
- How to handle incoming SMS messages to a Twilio number using a Convex-powered webhook

The concepts covered in this tutorial are transferrable to any third-party APIs that register webhooks. You'll be able to integrate just about anything with your app once you understand how HTTP actions work.
